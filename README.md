#Pauline's Portoflio
Hi, I'm Pauline! I'm a final year Biomedical Sciences student at UCL and set to go for a masters in computer science next year. I'm completely self taught other than a few coding modules
here and there. I started to code back in my first year of university and my interest and skills have only grown since. I'm using this profile to share any personal projects I'm working on
as I'm always looking to expand my own skills, as well as learn from other professionals in the field. Welcome!
